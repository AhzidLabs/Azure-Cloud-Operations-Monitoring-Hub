# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Cloud Operations & Monitoring Hub

## üìò Overview
The **Azure Cloud Operations & Monitoring Hub** is a simulated enterprise-grade environment designed to demonstrate practical Azure administration, automation, and governance skills.

Unlike the Cloud Resume Challenge, this project focuses on **managing a complete operational system** ‚Äî not just deploying a website.  
It represents the lifecycle of a real cloud environment: from secure infrastructure, automated deployments, monitoring, and self-healing, to cost governance and sustainability.

## üéØ Objectives
- Design and deploy a **secure, scalable Azure environment**
- Implement **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for automation and repeatability
- Integrate **monitoring, alerting, and AIOps automation**
- Apply **governance, RBAC security, and cost optimization**
- Demonstrate **sustainability** and **green cloud principles**
